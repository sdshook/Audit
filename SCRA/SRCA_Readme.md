## Overview

SRCA (Self-Regulated Cognitive Architecture) is a proof-of-concept implementation that demonstrates domain-specific reinforcement learning for autonomous cybersecurity operations. The system combines established AI techniques including memory systems, neural networks, and reinforcement learning to create a specialized system capable of learning cybersecurity response patterns through experience.

## Technical Architecture

### Memory Systems

#### Baby Dragon Hatchling (BDH) - Dual-Store Architecture
**Implementation**: Memory system inspired by Pathway's Baby Dragon Hatchling architecture for reinforcement learning applications.

SRCA implements a dual-store BDH system inspired by Pathway's biologically-plausible neural network research:

**Mathematical Formulation:**
```
For each memory trace i with state vector x_i and reward signal r:

Dual-Store Update:
W_reflective[i] = W_reflective[i] + η_pot * r * (x_i ⊗ x_i + E_pos[i] ⊗ E_pos[i])  [if r > 0]
W_empathic[i] = W_empathic[i] + η_pot * r * (x_i ⊗ x_i + E_pos[i] ⊗ E_pos[i])     [if r > 0]

W_reflective[i] = W_reflective[i] - η_dep * |r| * (x_i ⊗ x_i + E_neg[i] ⊗ E_neg[i]) [if r < 0, not protected]
W_empathic[i] = W_empathic[i] - η_dep * |r| * (x_i ⊗ x_i + E_neg[i] ⊗ E_neg[i])    [if r < 0, not protected]

Eligibility Trace Evolution:
E_pos[i](t+1) = γ_E * E_pos[i](t) + max(0, x_i ⊗ y_t).mean(axis=1)
E_neg[i](t+1) = γ_E * E_neg[i](t) + max(0, -(x_i ⊗ y_t)).mean(axis=1)

Memory Consolidation Criterion:
if |∑_t r_t| > τ_consolidation: transfer_to_PSI(trace_i)
```

**Key Features:**
- **Dual-Processing Architecture**: Separate reflective and empathic memory stores for different processing modes
- **Protected Memory Mechanism**: Security policies resist modification during learning
- **Eligibility Trace Enhancement**: Bidirectional traces for both strengthening and weakening pathways
- **Dynamic Consolidation**: Automatic transfer to long-term memory based on experience significance

**Benefits**: This dual-store architecture enables the system to maintain both analytical and contextual processing for cybersecurity decision-making.

#### Persistent Semantic Index (PSI) - Context Management
**Implementation**: Semantic memory system inspired by context management approaches.

SRCA's PSI implements semantic memory with specialized features for cybersecurity applications:

**Mathematical Formulation:**
```
Semantic Similarity with Valence Weighting:
score(query, doc_i) = cos_sim(query, doc_i.vector) * (1 + α * doc_i.valence)

where cos_sim(a, b) = (a · b) / (||a|| * ||b||)

Access-Based Strengthening:
access_weight(doc_i) = log(1 + access_count[doc_i])

Protected Memory Constraint:
if doc_i.protected and doc_i.valence < -0.5:
    doc_i.vector = immutable  // Ethical guardrails resist modification

Valence Evolution:
doc_i.valence(t+1) = λ * doc_i.valence(t) + (1-λ) * reward_signal

Multi-Criteria Retrieval:
retrieval_score = β₁ * semantic_sim + β₂ * valence_boost + β₃ * access_frequency
```

**Key Features:**
- **Valence-Weighted Retrieval**: Memories with positive associations are preferentially recalled
- **Protected Policy Memory**: Security policy entries resist modification during learning
- **Dynamic Access Patterns**: Frequently accessed memories become more accessible
- **Multi-Modal Indexing**: Tags, valence, and semantic vectors create associative structure

**Benefits**: This creates a semantic memory system that maintains security policies while adapting to cybersecurity experience.

#### Memory Consolidation
Mimics hippocampal-cortical transfer:
- Short-term episodic traces in BDH (hippocampus-like)
- Long-term semantic consolidation in PSI (cortex-like)
- Threshold-based transfer based on cumulative reward

### Cognitive Processing

#### Cognitive Mesh Neural Network (CMNN) - Distributed Processing
**Implementation**: Multi-node neural network architecture with message passing for distributed decision-making.

SRCA's CMNN implements distributed processing for cybersecurity decisions:

**Mathematical Formulation:**
```
Individual Node Processing:
h_i = ReLU(Linear([state_vec; context_vec]))
logits_i = W_policy * h_i
conf_i = σ(W_conf * h_i)
value_i = W_value * h_i

Message Passing Between Nodes:
H = [h_1, h_2, ..., h_N]  // Concatenated node states
M = W_message * flatten(H)  // Inter-node communication
H_updated = reshape(M, [N, hidden_dim])

Meta-Reasoning Over Collective:
meta_input = [flatten(logits), conf_vector, value_vector]
final_logits = W_meta * meta_input
action_probs = softmax(final_logits)

Collective Decision:
action ~ Categorical(action_probs)
```

**Key Features:**
- **Distributed Processing**: Multiple nodes process information in parallel
- **Message Passing**: Inter-node communication for information sharing
- **Meta-Reasoning**: Higher-level processing over individual node outputs
- **Confidence Aggregation**: System-level confidence from node consensus

#### Self-Monitoring Module - Performance Tracking
**Implementation**: Real-time monitoring of system performance and confidence metrics.

**Mathematical Formulation:**
```
Self-Monitoring State:
cognitive_state = [flatten(node_states), confidence_vector, value_vector]

Self-Awareness Metrics:
coherence = σ(W_coh * cognitive_state)
confidence = σ(W_conf * cognitive_state)  
arrogance = σ(W_arr * cognitive_state)

Metacognitive Loss:
L_meta = MSE(coherence, reward_signal) + 
         MSE(confidence, actual_performance) + 
         MSE(arrogance, overconfidence_penalty)

Self-Regulation Signal:
if confidence > 0.8 and actual_outcome < 0.5:
    arrogance_penalty += 0.1
else:
    arrogance_penalty = max(0, arrogance_penalty - 0.05)
```

#### Valence Controller - Reward Regulation System
**Implementation**: Reward regulation system with overconfidence detection.

**Mathematical Formulation:**
```
Empathy Factor Evolution:
empathy(t+1) = 0.7 * empathy(t) + 0.3 * human_feedback

Arrogance Penalty Dynamics:
prediction_error = |confidence - actual_outcome|
if confidence > 0.8 and actual_outcome < 0.5:
    arrogance_penalty = min(0.5, arrogance_penalty + 0.1)
else:
    arrogance_penalty = max(0, arrogance_penalty - 0.05)

Valence Regulation:
regulated_reward = base_reward * (1 + empathy - arrogance_penalty)

Guardrail Activation:
if regulated_reward < -1.0:
    trigger_safety_override()
    regulated_reward = max(-1.0, regulated_reward)
```

**Benefits**: These systems enable real-time performance monitoring and behavioral regulation for safe cybersecurity decision-making.
