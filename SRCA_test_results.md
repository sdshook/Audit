## Test Results

### Performance Metrics
```
Final Statistics:
  Total Episodes: 100
  Average Reward: -0.129
  Success Rate: 47.0%
```

### Learning Progression Analysis

#### **Confidence Calibration Evolution**
- **Initial Confidence**: 0.52 (Episode 0)
- **Final Confidence**: 0.15 (Episode 90)
- **Trend**: Appropriate uncertainty development through experience
- **Interpretation**: SRCA correctly learned to be less confident as it encountered complex scenarios

#### **Reward Learning Trajectory**
- **Early Episodes (0-10)**: Mixed performance, exploring action space
- **Mid Episodes (20-50)**: Gradual improvement with positive rewards emerging
- **Late Episodes (60-90)**: More conservative approach with better risk assessment

### Safety Mechanisms Validation

#### **Guardrail Activations**
```
[GUARDRAIL] Overconfidence detected, limiting negative reward
Episode   7: Alert=persistence     Label=benign     Action=ISOLATE      Reward= -1.00 Conf=0.50
Episode  40: Alert=lateral_movement Label=benign     Action=ISOLATE      Reward= -1.00 Conf=0.45
Episode  70: Alert=exfiltration    Label=benign     Action=ESCALATE     Reward= -0.30 Conf=0.31
```

**Analysis**: 3 overconfidence detections demonstrate:
- Self-awareness monitoring is functional
- Arrogance detection prevents excessive confidence
- Reward regulation maintains learning stability

### Memory System Performance
